In this portion of the application, you will complete a short coding challenge based on the Ada Jumpstart Curriculum. 
What we’re looking for
Ability to self-learn and apply material quickly because in Tech you will be learning everyday, forever
Ability to grasp the fundamentals of coding so that you are ready for Day 1 of Ada
Ability to describe code you have written, including how control flows through the program, what you tried, why you tried it, what worked and what didn’t

Tools
For this challenge, you will use this online REPL tool. If you are not sure where to get started, take a look at this lecture video that has REPL instructions and an introduction to programming concepts. The notes that go with the video are located here. 
Assignment: Song Time Calculator
You are going to create a program for calculating total listening time for songs, and determine which song has been listened to longest.
Primary Requirements
Create a song time calculator program that accepts the following input from the user for four different songs:
Name of the song
Length in seconds
Number of times the song has been played


Have the song time calculator output the following:
Listening time for each song
Total listening time for all songs
Which song has been listened to the longest total amount of time


Respond to the following prompts about the code you have written:
Describe something that you tried that didn't work and how you eventually fixed it
Describe a situation where your code may not perform as you would like
Example Output
Below is an example program output. Don’t forget, your code and program should be unique to you! User input is indicated in ~~ (tildes).
Welcome to the song time calculator!
