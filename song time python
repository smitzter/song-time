#4.times do

#Name of the song
puts "First song:"
  puts "name:"
  song = gets.chomp
  #song = song + 1 
#Length in seconds
  puts "length in seconds:"
  length = gets.chomp

#Number of times the song has been played
  puts "plays:"

      #plays = plays + 1
      
4.times do
    puts "First Song:"

    puts "length in seconds: " + length

#Total listening time for all songs

#Output

#Total listening time for all songs
